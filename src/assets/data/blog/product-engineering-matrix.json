      "introduction": "Originally developed as a simple scripting language to add interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has evolved into one of the most versatile and widely-used programming languages today. It is now a cornerstone of full-stack development, enabling the creation of dynamic websites, powerful server-side applications, and even mobile and desktop apps. With its simplicity and broad adoption, JavaScript has become an essential tool for developers across various platforms and environments.",

          "content": "Vanilla JavaScript was initially used for basic DOM manipulation to add interactivity. Developers then turned to libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to write less code and do more. As web apps grew complex, frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.dev) and [React](https://react.dev) introduced the SPA model. While great for apps, SPAs weren't ideal for websites. To address this, meta-frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (React) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com) (Vue) introduced SSG and SSR, enabling high-performance, SEO-friendly websites with modern JavaScript frameworks."

As web applications grew more complex, frameworks like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com), and others emerged, simplifying server-side development with powerful features such as routing, middleware, and modular architectures."
