      "introduction": "Originally developed as a simple scripting language to add interactivity to webpages, JavaScript has evolved into one of the most versatile and widely-used programming languages today. It is now a cornerstone of full-stack development, enabling the creation of dynamic websites, powerful server-side applications, and even mobile and desktop apps. With its simplicity and broad adoption, JavaScript has become an essential tool for developers across various platforms and environments.",

Developers then turned to libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to write less code and do more. As web apps grew complex, frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.dev) and [React](https://react.dev) introduced the SPA model. While great for apps, SPAs weren't ideal for websites. To address this, meta-frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (React) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com) (Vue) introduced SSG and SSR, enabling high-performance, SEO-friendly websites with modern JavaScript frameworks. Among the many front-end frameworks, React has emerged as the most popular choice among developers."

JavaScript excels in browser-based tasks but can struggle with CPU-intensive operations and heavy computations. Just because JavaScript can be used for nearly everything doesn’t mean it should be. It's essential to carefully evaluate whether it's the best tool for the job, particularly when performance and scalability are critical.",
